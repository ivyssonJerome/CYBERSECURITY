1.1
Identification
This initial stage allows individuals or devices which are analyzed to act as likely sources of significant evidence. SIMPLILEARN The said evidence can appear in variety of formats e.g., text messages, documents, web search histories, and on a variety of devices such as computers, tablets. EXTERRO

Preservation
This stage allows for data to be isolated, stored, and preserved. This also includes preventing anyone from possibly tampering with the evidence. EC-COUNCIL The data can then be copied so that it can be analysed and investigated. This is very critical in digital investigations since the original evidence must be preserved in order to be considered permissible as evidence in court. EXTERRO

Analysis
This stage serves as a methodical examination of the gathered evidence. This examination provides investigators data objects such as system and user-generated files, and also seeks specific answers and certain points of departure for conclusions. SIMPLILEARN Basically the investigators recontruct fragments of data and form a holistic narrative of what happened during the crime or matter being investigated. Experts rely on the evidence and their experience and expertise. It usually takes multiple examinations and efforts to arrive at a satsfactory theory of the crime or matter that occured. EXTERRO

Documentatiuon
This stage provides investigators with tried-and-true procedures for documenting the conclusion of the analysis. They should allow other competent examiners to read through and duplicate the results. SIMPLILEARN It also prepares a record of the data which will be presented either in the court or any other venue that the investigation is being resolved. Basically documentation forms a narrative recreation of the events in question, linking with the supporting evidence in the theory which should be compelling to an outsidr party that is charged with determining guilt or innocence. EXTERRO

Presentation
This is the final stage of the digital forensics process and it entails that investigators should summarize and draw a conclusion. EC-COUNCIL The most critical aspect of this stage is the collection of digital information, which may entail ejecting electronic devices from the scene and copying or printing the device(s). SIMPLILEARN The information from the documentation is then used by the investigator to explain whatever conclusion they have drawn about the event in question. Regardless of where the conclusion is presented, the investigator must translate their expert conclusions into a comprehensible narrative that even a non-expert can easily understand and judge for themselves according to the presented details and evidence.

AI
Even though AI is a technology that can be used to improve the livelihood of many individuals and make them more efficient, even criminals can have access to AI since it is also available to them. Cybercriminals use cutting-edge AI tools to orchestrate sophisticated attacks, breaching security defences like never before. It is now getting more complicated for organisations to keep up with the changes and new threat due to the advancement of AI and other technologies. As AI algorithms evolve, cybercriminals become more adept at bypassing security measures, adapting their strategies quickly, and exploiting vulnerabilities.

Information Security Management System
This is a systematic approach to managing a company’s sensitive information. This component encompasses people processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process. The process helps organisations protect their information in a way that is efficient, consistent, and cost-efficient. It is crucial to establish an ISMS in order for organisations to aim at protecting their intellectual property, financial data, employee details, or any information entrusted to them by third parties. ISEOBLUE

Risk Assessment and Treatment
Information security risk management formulates the foundation of an effective ISMS, providing guidelines for performing risk assessment and treatment. ISO 27001 requires organisations to perform regular assessments to identify the information security risks associated with their information assets. Now, these risks will then be analyzed and evaluated to determine how they affect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the information. After going through with the risk assessment, an organization should apply appropriate techniques to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid the risks. It is vital to document these risks and their treatment so that demonstrating compliance with ISO 27001 is straight-forward. ISEOBLUE

ISO 27001 Controls
The ISO 27001:2022 outlines a comprehensive set of ISO 27001 controls within Annex A, which outlines a set of 93 security controls, which are then grouped into four themes which include organizational, people, physical, and technological. It is designed to address various aspects of information security. These controls include measures for access control, cryptography, incident management and physical security, among others. When these controls are implemented, it will ensure that the organisation’s ISMS effectively mitigates risks and safeguarding sensitive information. ISMSONLINE

Statement of Applicability (SoA)
This is a critical document that clearly outlines the control objectives and controls that have relevancy in the orgainsation’s ISMS. This document serves as a declaration of which of the standard’s 114 controls from Annex A, which has been explained in the ISO 27001 controls section, have been selected and applied within the organisations. It also provides justification for inclusion or exclusion of these controls, which reflect how each decision supports the management of information security risks. The SoA has an insurance that all stakeholders are aware of which controls are implemented and provides evidence of the organisation’s commitment to information security. ISEOBLUE

Continuous Improvement
There’s an emphasis of the importance of continuous improvement by the ISO 27001 through the Plan-DO-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. An iterative process will ensure that the ISMS remains effective and responsive to internal and external changes. Organisations can identify areas that require improvement and take corrective actions by continually monitoring and reviewing the system’s performance. This will not only enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the ISMS but also aligns the organisation's information security management practices with its evolving security landscape. ISEOBLUE

https://www.iseoblue.com/post/understanding-iso-27001-meaning-requirements-and-key-principles-for-effective-information-security

Confidentiality
This principle translates to data and systems that must be protected against any form of unauthorized access, from people, processes or unauthorized applications. This is enforced by using technological controls like multifactor authentication, security tokens and data encryption. What to understand abour confidentiality is that only the right people can access the information held by the organization. CONTROL CASE

Integrity
This principle allows for the use of processes that ensure that data is free of errors and manipulations, such as establishing if only authorized personnel has access to confidential data. This is done by vertifying the accuracy, trustworthiness, completness of data. Lastly, information integrity means data that the organization will use to pursue its business or secure effectively for others is reliably stored and not erased or damaged. CONTROL CASE

Availability
This principle typically refers to the maintenance and monitoring of information security management systems. It involves removing any restrictions in security processes, minimizing vulnerabilities by updating the software and hardware to the latest firmware, which then boosts business continuity by adding certain redundancies, and minimizing data loss by adding backups and disaster recovery solutions. When data is available, it means that the organizations and its clients can access the information whenever it is necessary so that business purposes and customer expectations are satisfied. CONTROL CASE

Accountability
This principle promotes an information security policy and establishes crucial roles and responsibilities for information security within the organisation. It also ensures that imformation security objectives align with the organisation's strategic goals. Lastly, it demonstrates commintment to informations security through active participation and support. ISEOBLUE

Compliance
This principle helps organisations with regulatory compliance, whn then ensures they meet various legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements related to information security and avoid any form of penalties and legal isssues. Organizations are provided with compliance certifications. ISO management system standards such as ISO 27001 and ISO 27701, are very crucial indemonstrating compliance with regulations like GDPR and enhancing organisational trust. ISEOBLUE

Risk Management
This principle focuses on identifying, assessing and mitigating any risks presented to an organisation's information security. This then ensures that any potential threat is systematically managed and appropriate controls are implemented to protect information assets. This will include selecting and implementing suitable security controls. ISEOBLUE

Continuous Improvement
This principle entails that organisations are required to review and update their ISMS regularly. This involves conducting regular internal audits to assess the effectiveness of the ISMS. Also, management reviews can be performed to ensure the system's continuous suitability and adequacy. Oragnisations can also implement corrective actions to address any issue that has been identified and prevent recurrence. It also involves organisations seeking feedback from stakeholders to improve information security practices. ISEOBLUE

3. The breach at TransUnion, coupled with other similar incidents, underscores the growing threat posed by cyberattacks on the financial system. As cyber threats evolve, the global community must implement robust strategies to protect sensitive financial data and the integrity of the global financial system. Below are detailed strategies that can better protect the global financial system against cyber threats.

### 1. **Stronger Authentication and Access Control Measures**
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** As evidenced by the TransUnion breach, weak or easily guessable credentials (e.g., the use of “password”) can lead to catastrophic failures in securing sensitive data. Financial institutions must implement MFA, which requires multiple forms of verification (something you know, something you have, and something you are) before granting access to sensitive systems or data. 
   - **Zero Trust Architecture:** Adopting a zero-trust security model ensures that no device or user, inside or outside the network, is trusted by default. Every access request should be verified through continuous monitoring, providing additional layers of defense against unauthorized access.
   - **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Ensuring that employees and users have only the minimum necessary access to perform their duties can prevent the excessive exposure of sensitive data in case of an attack.

### 2. **Comprehensive Cybersecurity Frameworks**
   - **Adopt International Cybersecurity Standards:** Institutions should adhere to internationally recognized cybersecurity standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure that they follow best practices in securing financial data.
   - **Cybersecurity Risk Management:** Financial institutions must establish a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management framework, continuously identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities. This includes regularly assessing and addressing risks and ensuring business continuity plans are in place to minimize damage in the event of an attack.

### 3. **Advanced Threat Detection and Incident Response**
   - **AI and Machine Learning for Threat Detection:** The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can help identify unusual activity in real time, enabling quicker responses to cyber threats. These technologies can analyze vast amounts of data to detect anomalies and predict potential threats based on historical patterns.
   - **Incident Response Plans:** Financial institutions need to have detailed and practiced incident response plans in place. These plans should include clear communication strategies, coordination with law enforcement, and collaboration with cybersecurity experts to quickly identify and contain the breach. An effective incident response can reduce the damage and ensure faster recovery.

### 4. **Improved Data Protection and Encryption**
   - **End-to-End Encryption:** Sensitive financial data, such as customer records and transactions, should be encrypted both in transit and at rest. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.
   - **Data Minimization and Segmentation:** Financial institutions should minimize the amount of sensitive data they collect and store, reducing the attack surface. Additionally, segmenting data into smaller, isolated parts can help contain breaches to a limited scope, preventing the compromise of large swathes of personal data.

### 5. **Collaboration Between Financial Institutions and Governments**
   - **Public-Private Partnerships:** Governments and financial institutions must collaborate more closely to address cyber threats. Governments can provide regulatory guidance and support, while private sector organizations can share threat intelligence and best practices. Global cooperation in these areas can help create a stronger, more resilient financial system.
   - **Global Cybersecurity Regulations:** Establishing and enforcing international cybersecurity regulations can ensure that financial institutions are held to consistent standards, reducing vulnerabilities that arise from different regulatory approaches across regions. Regulations such as the EU’s GDPR or South Africa's POPIA provide valuable frameworks for data protection and accountability.
   - **Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing:** Financial institutions and governments should have real-time cyber threat intelligence-sharing mechanisms. By sharing information about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methodologies, they can better prepare for and defend against cyberattacks. This collaboration can also help identify common adversaries or techniques used by cybercriminals, facilitating coordinated responses.

### 6. **Employee Training and Awareness**
   - **Regular Cybersecurity Training:** Employees should be regularly trained on cybersecurity best practices, including how to recognize phishing attempts, handle sensitive data, and respond to suspicious activity. The human element is often the weakest link in cybersecurity, and training is essential in reducing the risk of successful social engineering attacks.
   - **Simulated Cybersecurity Drills:** Regular cybersecurity drills, simulating actual cyberattack scenarios, can help employees practice response procedures. This builds readiness and helps employees understand their roles in the event of an attack.

### 7. **Stronger Regulations and Penalties for Non-Compliance**
   - **Enforcement of Data Protection Laws:** Governments should enforce stringent data protection laws that require companies to secure their systems adequately. In South Africa, for instance, the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) holds companies accountable for mishandling sensitive personal information, ensuring they implement necessary safeguards. Similar laws should be enforced globally to maintain consistency in data protection practices.
   - **Financial Penalties for Data Breaches:** Institutions that fail to meet cybersecurity standards or neglect proper security practices should face financial penalties. These penalties would serve as a deterrent to negligence and encourage financial organizations to invest more in protecting their systems.

### 8. **Cybersecurity Insurance**
   - **Invest in Cyber Insurance:** While cybersecurity insurance cannot prevent an attack, it can help mitigate financial losses from breaches, allowing financial institutions to recover more quickly and effectively. Insurers can also work with organizations to improve their cybersecurity posture by providing guidance on risk management practices.

### 9. **Consumer Education and Transparency**
   - **Public Awareness Campaigns:** Consumers must be made aware of how their data is being used, stored, and protected by financial institutions. Regularly educating the public about cybersecurity threats and best practices can help them take the necessary precautions to protect their personal data.
   - **Transparency in Breach Reporting:** Financial institutions should be transparent about data breaches. When an incident occurs, they should inform consumers promptly and provide guidance on how they can protect themselves, such as offering credit monitoring or fraud prevention services.

### 10. **Emerging Technologies for Cyber Defense**
   - **Blockchain Technology for Secure Transactions:** The use of blockchain in financial transactions can help provide a secure, decentralized ledger system that is resistant to tampering and fraud. Blockchain’s transparency and traceability can enhance trust and security within the financial system.
   - **Quantum Computing Resilience:** As quantum computing advances, it could potentially break traditional encryption methods. Financial institutions should invest in research and development to create quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, ensuring that future systems can remain secure in the face of evolving technology.

---

### Conclusion
The growing threat of cyberattacks on the global financial system calls for an integrated and multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. Financial institutions must prioritize the implementation of advanced technologies, rigorous risk management practices, and regulatory compliance to protect sensitive financial data. At the same time, global cooperation among governments, private sector entities, and consumers is essential to strengthening the security and resilience of the financial system. Ultimately, safeguarding against cyber threats is not just a matter of technology but also of policy, awareness, and collaboration across the financial ecosystem.
