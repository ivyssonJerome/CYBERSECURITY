1.1
Identification
This initial stage allows individuals or devices which are analyzed to act as likely sources of significant evidence. SIMPLILEARN The said evidence can appear in variety of formats e.g., text messages, documents, web search histories, and on a variety of devices such as computers, tablets. EXTERRO

Preservation
This stage allows for data to be isolated, stored, and preserved. This also includes preventing anyone from possibly tampering with the evidence. EC-COUNCIL The data can then be copied so that it can be analysed and investigated. This is very critical in digital investigations since the original evidence must be preserved in order to be considered permissible as evidence in court. EXTERRO

Analysis
This stage serves as a methodical examination of the gathered evidence. This examination provides investigators data objects such as system and user-generated files, and also seeks specific answers and certain points of departure for conclusions. SIMPLILEARN Basically the investigators recontruct fragments of data and form a holistic narrative of what happened during the crime or matter being investigated. Experts rely on the evidence and their experience and expertise. It usually takes multiple examinations and efforts to arrive at a satsfactory theory of the crime or matter that occured. EXTERRO

Documentatiuon
This stage provides investigators with tried-and-true procedures for documenting the conclusion of the analysis. They should allow other competent examiners to read through and duplicate the results. SIMPLILEARN It also prepares a record of the data which will be presented either in the court or any other venue that the investigation is being resolved. Basically documentation forms a narrative recreation of the events in question, linking with the supporting evidence in the theory which should be compelling to an outsidr party that is charged with determining guilt or innocence. EXTERRO

Presentation
This is the final stage of the digital forensics process and it entails that investigators should summarize and draw a conclusion. EC-COUNCIL The most critical aspect of this stage is the collection of digital information, which may entail ejecting electronic devices from the scene and copying or printing the device(s). SIMPLILEARN The information from the documentation is then used by the investigator to explain whatever conclusion they have drawn about the event in question. Regardless of where the conclusion is presented, the investigator must translate their expert conclusions into a comprehensible narrative that even a non-expert can easily understand and judge for themselves according to the presented details and evidence.

AI
Even though AI is a technology that can be used to improve the livelihood of many individuals and make them more efficient, even criminals can have access to AI since it is also available to them. Cybercriminals use cutting-edge AI tools to orchestrate sophisticated attacks, breaching security defences like never before. It is now getting more complicated for organisations to keep up with the changes and new threat due to the advancement of AI and other technologies. As AI algorithms evolve, cybercriminals become more adept at bypassing security measures, adapting their strategies quickly, and exploiting vulnerabilities.

Information Security Management System
This is a systematic approach to managing a company’s sensitive information. This component encompasses people processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process. The process helps organisations protect their information in a way that is efficient, consistent, and cost-efficient. It is crucial to establish an ISMS in order for organisations to aim at protecting their intellectual property, financial data, employee details, or any information entrusted to them by third parties. ISEOBLUE

Risk Assessment and Treatment
Information security risk management formulates the foundation of an effective ISMS, providing guidelines for performing risk assessment and treatment. ISO 27001 requires organisations to perform regular assessments to identify the information security risks associated with their information assets. Now, these risks will then be analyzed and evaluated to determine how they affect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the information. After going through with the risk assessment, an organization should apply appropriate techniques to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid the risks. It is vital to document these risks and their treatment so that demonstrating compliance with ISO 27001 is straight-forward. ISEOBLUE

ISO 27001 Controls
The ISO 27001:2022 outlines a comprehensive set of ISO 27001 controls within Annex A, which outlines a set of 93 security controls, which are then grouped into four themes which include organizational, people, physical, and technological. It is designed to address various aspects of information security. These controls include measures for access control, cryptography, incident management and physical security, among others. When these controls are implemented, it will ensure that the organisation’s ISMS effectively mitigates risks and safeguarding sensitive information. ISMSONLINE

Statement of Applicability (SoA)
This is a critical document that clearly outlines the control objectives and controls that have relevancy in the orgainsation’s ISMS. This document serves as a declaration of which of the standard’s 114 controls from Annex A, which has been explained in the ISO 27001 controls section, have been selected and applied within the organisations. It also provides justification for inclusion or exclusion of these controls, which reflect how each decision supports the management of information security risks. The SoA has an insurance that all stakeholders are aware of which controls are implemented and provides evidence of the organisation’s commitment to information security. ISEOBLUE

Continuous Improvement
There’s an emphasis of the importance of continuous improvement by the ISO 27001 through the Plan-DO-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. An iterative process will ensure that the ISMS remains effective and responsive to internal and external changes. Organisations can identify areas that require improvement and take corrective actions by continually monitoring and reviewing the system’s performance. This will not only enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the ISMS but also aligns the organisation's information security management practices with its evolving security landscape. ISEOBLUE


2.3 Explain the seven core principles that guide information security management under
ISO/IEC 27001.

Confidentiality
This principle translates to data and systems that must be protected against any form of unauthorized access, from people, processes or unauthorized applications. This is enforced by using technological controls like multifactor authentication, security tokens and data encryption. What to understand abour confidentiality is that only the right people can access the information held by the organization. CONTROL CASE

Integrity
This principle allows for the use of processes that ensure that data is free of errors and manipulations, such as establishing if only authorized personnel has access to confidential data. This is done by vertifying the accuracy, trustworthiness, completness of data. Lastly, information integrity means data that the organization will use to pursue its business or secure effectively for others is reliably stored and not erased or damaged. CONTROL CASE

Availability
This principle typically refers to the maintenance and monitoring of information security management systems. It involves removing any restrictions in security processes, minimizing vulnerabilities by updating the software and hardware to the latest firmware, which then boosts business continuity by adding certain redundancies, and minimizing data loss by adding backups and disaster recovery solutions. When data is available, it means that the organizations and its clients can access the information whenever it is necessary so that business purposes and customer expectations are satisfied. CONTROL CASE

Accountability
This principle promotes an information security policy and establishes crucial roles and responsibilities for information security within the organisation. It also ensures that imformation security objectives align with the organisation's strategic goals. Lastly, it demonstrates commintment to informations security through active participation and support. ISEOBLUE

Compliance
This principle helps organisations with regulatory compliance, whn then ensures they meet various legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements related to information security and avoid any form of penalties and legal isssues. Organizations are provided with compliance certifications. ISO management system standards such as ISO 27001 and ISO 27701, are very crucial indemonstrating compliance with regulations like GDPR and enhancing organisational trust. ISEOBLUE

Risk Management
This principle focuses on identifying, assessing and mitigating any risks presented to an organisation's information security. This then ensures that any potential threat is systematically managed and appropriate controls are implemented to protect information assets. This will include selecting and implementing suitable security controls. ISEOBLUE

Continuous Improvement
This principle entails that organisations are required to review and update their ISMS regularly. This involves conducting regular internal audits to assess the effectiveness of the ISMS. Also, management reviews can be performed to ensure the system's continuous suitability and adequacy. Oragnisations can also implement corrective actions to address any issue that has been identified and prevent recurrence. It also involves organisations seeking feedback from stakeholders to improve information security practices. ISEOBLUE
