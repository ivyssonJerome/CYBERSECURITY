Identification
This initial stage allows individuals or devices which are analyzed to act as likely sources of significant evidence. SIMPLILEARN The said evidence can appear in variety of formats e.g., text messages, documents, web search histories, and on a variety of devices such as computers, tablets. EXTERRO

Preservation
This stage allows for data to be isolated, stored, and preserved. This also includes preventing anyone from possibly tampering with the evidence. EC-COUNCIL The data can then be copied so that it can be analysed and investigated. This is very critical in digital investigations since the original evidence must be preserved in order to be considered permissible as evidence in court. EXTERRO

Analysis
This stage serves as a methodical examination of the gathered evidence. This examination provides investigators data objects such as system and user-generated files, and also seeks specific answers and certain points of departure for conclusions. SIMPLILEARN Basically the investigators recontruct fragments of data and form a holistic narrative of what happened during the crime or matter being investigated. Experts rely on the evidence and their experience and expertise. It usually takes multiple examinations and efforts to arrive at a satsfactory theory of the crime or matter that occured. EXTERRO

Documentation
This stage provides investigators with tried-and-true procedures for documenting the conclusion of the analysis. They should allow other competent examiners to read through and duplicate the results. SIMPLILEARN It also prepares a record of the data which will be presented either in the court or any other venue that the investigation is being resolved. Basically documentation forms a narrative recreation of the events in question, linking with the supporting evidence in the theory which should be compelling to an outsidr party that is charged with determining guilt or innocence. EXTERRO

Presentation
This is the final stage of the digital forensics process and it entails that investigators should summarize and draw a conclusion. EC-COUNCIL The most critical aspect of this stage is the collection of digital information, which may entail ejecting electronic devices from the scene and copying or printing the device(s). SIMPLILEARN The information from the documentation is then used by the investigator to explain whatever conclusion they have drawn about the event in question. Regardless of where the conclusion is presented, the investigator must translate their expert conclusions into a comprehensible narrative that even a non-expert can easily understand and judge for themselves according to the presented details and evidence.

AI
Even though AI is a technology that can be used to improve the livelihood of many individuals and make them more efficient, even criminals can have access to AI since it is also available to them. Cybercriminals use cutting-edge AI tools to orchestrate sophisticated attacks, breaching security defences like never before. It is now getting more complicated for organisations to keep up with the changes and new threat due to the advancement of AI and other technologies. As AI algorithms evolve, cybercriminals become more adept at bypassing security measures, adapting their strategies quickly, and exploiting vulnerabilities.

Information Security Management System
This is a systematic approach to managing a company’s sensitive information. This component encompasses people processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process. The process helps organisations protect their information in a way that is efficient, consistent, and cost-efficient. It is crucial to establish an ISMS in order for organisations to aim at protecting their intellectual property, financial data, employee details, or any information entrusted to them by third parties. ISEOBLUE

Risk Assessment and Treatment
Information security risk management formulates the foundation of an effective ISMS, providing guidelines for performing risk assessment and treatment. ISO 27001 requires organisations to perform regular assessments to identify the information security risks associated with their information assets. Now, these risks will then be analyzed and evaluated to determine how they affect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the information. After going through with the risk assessment, an organization should apply appropriate techniques to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid the risks. It is vital to document these risks and their treatment so that demonstrating compliance with ISO 27001 is straight-forward. ISEOBLUE

ISO 27001 Controls
The ISO 27001:2022 outlines a comprehensive set of ISO 27001 controls within Annex A, which outlines a set of 93 security controls, which are then grouped into four themes which include organizational, people, physical, and technological. It is designed to address various aspects of information security. These controls include measures for access control, cryptography, incident management and physical security, among others. When these controls are implemented, it will ensure that the organisation’s ISMS effectively mitigates risks and safeguarding sensitive information. ISMSONLINE

Statement of Applicability (SoA)
This is a critical document that clearly outlines the control objectives and controls that have relevancy in the orgainsation’s ISMS. This document serves as a declaration of which of the standard’s 114 controls from Annex A, which has been explained in the ISO 27001 controls section, have been selected and applied within the organisations. It also provides justification for inclusion or exclusion of these controls, which reflect how each decision supports the management of information security risks. The SoA has an insurance that all stakeholders are aware of which controls are implemented and provides evidence of the organisation’s commitment to information security. ISEOBLUE

Continuous Improvement
There’s an emphasis of the importance of continuous improvement by the ISO 27001 through the Plan-DO-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. An iterative process will ensure that the ISMS remains effective and responsive to internal and external changes. Organisations can identify areas that require improvement and take corrective actions by continually monitoring and reviewing the system’s performance. This will not only enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the ISMS but also aligns the organisation's information security management practices with its evolving security landscape. ISEOBLUE


2.3 Explain the seven core principles that guide information security management under
ISO/IEC 27001. 
https://www.controlcase.com/what-is-iso-27001/
https://www.iseoblue.com/post/understanding-iso-27001-meaning-requirements-and-key-principles-for-effective-information-security

Confidentiality
This principle translates to data and systems that must be protected against any form of unauthorized access, from people, processes or unauthorized applications. This is enforced by using technological controls like multifactor authentication, security tokens and data encryption. What to understand abour confidentiality is that only the right people can access the information held by the organization. CONTROL CASE

Integrity
This principle allows for the use of processes that ensure that data is free of errors and manipulations, such as establishing if only authorized personnel has access to confidential data. This is done by vertifying the accuracy, trustworthiness, completness of data. Lastly, information integrity means data that the organization will use to pursue its business or secure effectively for others is reliably stored and not erased or damaged. CONTROL CASE

Availability
This principle typically refers to the maintenance and monitoring of information security management systems. It involves removing any restrictions in security processes, minimizing vulnerabilities by updating the software and hardware to the latest firmware, which then boosts business continuity by adding certain redundancies, and minimizing data loss by adding backups and disaster recovery solutions. When data is available, it means that the organizations and its clients can access the information whenever it is necessary so that business purposes and customer expectations are satisfied. CONTROL CASE

Accountability
This principle promotes an information security policy and establishes crucial roles and responsibilities for information security within the organisation. It also ensures that imformation security objectives align with the organisation's strategic goals. Lastly, it demonstrates commintment to informations security through active participation and support. ISEOBLUE

Compliance
This principle helps organisations with regulatory compliance, whn then ensures they meet various legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements related to information security and avoid any form of penalties and legal isssues. Organizations are provided with compliance certifications. ISO management system standards such as ISO 27001 and ISO 27701, are very crucial indemonstrating compliance with regulations like GDPR and enhancing organisational trust. ISEOBLUE

Risk Management
This principle focuses on identifying, assessing and mitigating any risks presented to an organisation's information security. This then ensures that any potential threat is systematically managed and appropriate controls are implemented to protect information assets. This will include selecting and implementing suitable security controls. ISEOBLUE

Continuous Improvement
This principle entails that organisations are required to review and update their ISMS regularly. This involves conducting regular internal audits to assess the effectiveness of the ISMS. Also, management reviews can be performed to ensure the system's continuous suitability and adequacy. Oragnisations can also implement corrective actions to address any issue that has been identified and prevent recurrence. It also involves organisations seeking feedback from stakeholders to improve information security practices. ISEOBLUE

The first strategy that can better protect the Global Financial System against cyber threats is enforcing stronger authentication and access control measures. The multi-factor authentication is one that prompts users to enter a second factor in order to identify the users after they initially sign in to the application or system. In this case, when logging into a banking app, in order to access the services provided by the app, the user will have to go through verification processes such as biometric access. This has to be done due to the evidence of the TransUnion breach which had a weak and guessable password, which led to the hacker group gaining easy access to the server. This is the reason financial institutions should implement multi-factor authentication. MICROSOFT They can also implement a zero trust architecture, which directs continuous monitoring and validation of these tools to ensure that the global financial system can provide secure deployment and service delivery. This then means moving from one-time, static access with implicit trust to dynamic authorization for continued access and proactive detection of unusual behaviour by cyber criminals. In a way, the zero trust architecture ensures that every device whether they have access to the network or not is not trusted by default. PALOALTONETWORKS

The second strategy will be to impose comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks. With adopting international cybersecurity standards, the financial institution must adhere to the internationally recognized cybersecurity standars such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation which then ensures that they folloe the best practices insecuring financial data. The ISO/IEC 27001 will provide the global financial system with a model which establishes, implements, maintains, and continually improves the risk-managed information security management system. It also provides reassurance to sponsors, shareholders, and customers in the global financial system the ability to expertly control its risk managament. TORQUE The NIST Cybersecurity Framework will provide guidance to the global financial system to manage future cybersecurity attacks by offering a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by the global financial system to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. NIST The EU's General Data Protection Regulation will provide the global financial system with rules relating to the protection of the masses with regard to the processing of financial data and rules relating to the free movement of financial data. GDPR They can also implement cybersecurity risk management, which continuously identifies, analyses, evaluates, and addresses any potential threats and vulnerabilities. 

https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/ai-in-threat-detection
https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Incident-Response-Plan-Basics_508c.pdf
The third strategy will be to use advanced threat detection and incident response systems and mechanisms. AI and machine learning can help the global financial system detect new and complex threats quickly. By analysing data from the TransUnion breach, the algorithms can identify patterns and predict any potential threats, therefor improving the accuracy and speed of threat detection. There are two ways to use machine learning which include supervised and unsupervised learning. With supervised learning, the system will be trained on a labeled dataset, distinguishing between between normal and malicious activities and learns to predict outcomes based on input-output mapping. With unsupervised learning, since the model does not use labelled data, it will rather learn to identify anomalies, patterns, and relationships. It can detect unknown or emerging threats by identifying the deviation from standars baselines of what is considered normal. Now, advanced AI algorithms such as deep learning and neural networks can help the global financial system analyze vast data sets such as the financial data for any suspicious patterns using existing intelligence to improve their predictive capabilities over time. PALOATLONETWORKS With incident response planning, it is a written document, that will help financial institutions before, during, and after a confirmed or suspected security incident. This will help the global financial system as financial institutions have to provide detailed incident response plans in place. These plans must include clear communication strategies, and collaborations with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts to quickly identify and contain the breach before it becomes a major issue. CISA

The fourth strategy will be to improve data encryption and protection.

The fifth strategy will be to enforce collaborations between financial institutions and governments.

The last strategy will be to emphasize on using emerging technologies for cyber defense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### 4. **Improved Data Protection and Encryption**
   - **End-to-End Encryption:** Sensitive financial data, such as customer records and transactions, should be encrypted both in transit and at rest. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.
   - **Data Minimization and Segmentation:** Financial institutions should minimize the amount of sensitive data they collect and store, reducing the attack surface. Additionally, segmenting data into smaller, isolated parts can help contain breaches to a limited scope, preventing the compromise of large swathes of personal data.

### 5. **Collaboration Between Financial Institutions and Governments**
   - **Public-Private Partnerships:** Governments and financial institutions must collaborate more closely to address cyber threats. Governments can provide regulatory guidance and support, while private sector organizations can share threat intelligence and best practices. Global cooperation in these areas can help create a stronger, more resilient financial system.
   - **Global Cybersecurity Regulations:** Establishing and enforcing international cybersecurity regulations can ensure that financial institutions are held to consistent standards, reducing vulnerabilities that arise from different regulatory approaches across regions. Regulations such as the EU’s GDPR or South Africa's POPIA provide valuable frameworks for data protection and accountability.
   - **Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing:** Financial institutions and governments should have real-time cyber threat intelligence-sharing mechanisms. By sharing information about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methodologies, they can better prepare for and defend against cyberattacks. This collaboration can also help identify common adversaries or techniques used by cybercriminals, facilitating coordinated responses.

### 10. **Emerging Technologies for Cyber Defense**
   - **Blockchain Technology for Secure Transactions:** The use of blockchain in financial transactions can help provide a secure, decentralized ledger system that is resistant to tampering and fraud. Blockchain’s transparency and traceability can enhance trust and security within the financial system.
   - **Quantum Computing Resilience:** As quantum computing advances, it could potentially break traditional encryption methods. Financial institutions should invest in research and development to create quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, ensuring that future systems can remain secure in the face of evolving technology.

---

### Conclusion
The growing threat of cyberattacks on the global financial system calls for an integrated and multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. Financial institutions must prioritize the implementation of advanced technologies, rigorous risk management practices, and regulatory compliance to protect sensitive financial data. At the same time, global cooperation among governments, private sector entities, and consumers is essential to strengthening the security and resilience of the financial system. Ultimately, safeguarding against cyber threats is not just a matter of technology but also of policy, awareness, and collaboration across the financial ecosystem.
